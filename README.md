# US-RSE Organizational Documents

## Contents

This repository contains the official copy of the documents included.  All documents related to US-RSE's structure and operations as an organization should be added here.  Policy documents may also be included here.

Whenever possible, to help ensure current versions of documents are referenced, please link to the pages here, rather than copying the information elsewhere.

### Current Documents

## Procedures

All documents should be entered in markdown, which is then automatically rendered for viewing.  

Draft documents/changes should be developed on a branch.  If the document requires approval of a certain set of people (for example, the Steering Committee needs to vote), the relevant people should be assigned as reviewers on a pull request and the document should not be merged until they have approved. 

## Permissions

Current members of the [US-RSE Steering Committee](https://us-rse.org/steering-committee/) will have write permissions for this repository.

Anyone can suggest minor (copyediting) changes; please create a pull request.

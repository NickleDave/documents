## Procedures

Before making any edits to existing documents here, it's best to start a conversation about the issue.  For changes to the current set of documents, or to request the addition of a new document, please contact the Steering Committee (@sc on Slack, or contact@us-rse.og), since they need to approve changes.

### Editing Procedures

Once there is general consent about changes:

All documents should be entered in markdown, which is then automatically rendered for viewing.  

Draft documents/changes should be developed on a branch.  If the document requires approval of a certain set of people (for example, the Steering Committee needs to vote), the relevant people should be assigned as reviewers on a pull request and the document should not be merged until they have approved. 

## Permissions

Current members of the [US-RSE Steering Committee](https://us-rse.org/steering-committee/) will have write permissions for this repository.

Anyone can suggest minor (copyediting) changes; please create a pull request. For content changes, please contact the Steering Committee (@sc on Slack, or contact@us-rse.og).

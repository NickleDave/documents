## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct is designed to protect the US-RSE community and its members from physical and psychological harm.
To this end, we consider the following behaviors unacceptable in any US-RSE community spaces, in person or online:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks.
- Unwanted physical contact, sexual comments, and/or sharing of sexual material, whether in person or online.
- Stalking or harassment.
- Refusing to call someone by their preferred name or pronouns (for example, “dead naming”).
- Threats or incitement of violence.
- Behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting in the United States.
- Continuing to communicate with someone after they have asked that they not be contacted.
- Deliberately disclosing information given in private confidence (for example, “outing”), unless it is to report a violation of this code of conduct (for example, harassment).
- Deliberate attempts to circumvent these enumerated behaviors or otherwise cause harm to the community or its members.

The Code of Conduct will be enforced by the committee (members enumerated below), which is empowered to respond with sanctions to anyone who conducts themselves in any of these ways, such as:
- Issuance of formal warnings and possible mediation.
- Removal of responsibilities, privileges, or access to community spaces.
- Temporary bans from community spaces.
- Permanent bans from community spaces.

The Code of Conduct committee will select a Case Lead to serve as a point of contact for a report, and is advised to complete a case within one month when possible.
The reporter need only contact a member of the committee directly to initiate a report or submit an email to coc@us-rse.org, which should include the answers to these questions:
- Who performed the violating action?
  If not known, please supply details to help identify them where possible.
- What was the violating action?
- How should we contact you in response to this report?

The reporting party/parties will be kept confidential.
Any committee members involved in the report must recuse themselves from the incident.
A failure to recuse in such a situation will be considered a Code of Conduct Violation and result in the removal of the committee member by the Steering Committee.

The committee will adjudicate an appropriate response to the incident.
The committee is responsible for communicating their response and reasoning to the reporter privately.
Responses must be anonymized and recorded in the transparency log for semi-annual release.

## Submitting a Report

### How to Submit a Report

If you feel your safety is in jeopardy or the situation is an emergency, contact local law enforcement before making a report to the US-RSE Association.
In the U.S., dial 911.

The US-RSE Association is committed to promptly addressing any reported issues.
If you have experienced or witnessed behavior that violates the US-RSE Association Code of Conduct, please send an email to coc@us-rse.org.
These emails are sent to the US-RSE Code of Conduct Enforcement Committee.
You may also contact committee members individually in order to initiate a report. 

You will be asked the following questions as part of the reporting process:

- Who performed the violating action?
  If not known, please supply details to help identify them where possible.
- What was the violating action?
- How should we contact you in response to this report?

The reporting party/parties will be kept confidential.

### What to Expect After You Report

The US-RSE Association is committed to promptly addressing any reported issues.
You will be contacted as quickly as possible by a member of the committee acknowledging your report, and shortly thereafter be appointed a case lead who will be your point of contact throughout the report response process.
The Case Lead may ask additional questions for clarification.
After information has been gathered, the Case Lead will inform you of the committee’s decision and the consequences of any violations of the Code of Conduct.

There will be a private record made of the case, to be accessible to all current and future committee members.
This is to further ensure safety by empowering the committee to identify repeat occurrences or cases where individuals are targeted.
An anonymized and shortened version of the case added to the transparency log, to be publicly available at the next time the log is shared.
By keeping a public and anonymized log, we hope to both demonstrate that we take these matters seriously and will be responsive to future violations.

## Proposing Changes to the Code of Conduct

Should changes need to be made to the US-RSE Code of Conduct, US-RSE members may draft a proposed set of changes.
This can be done by opening a Pull Request to the [US-RSE documents repository](https://github.com/USRSE/documents).
Your Pull Request should include a well-thought-out justification for the proposed changes.
The Steering Committee must vote on and approve any proposed changes in order for them to be incorporated.
